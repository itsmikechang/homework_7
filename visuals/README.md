  ## Description
  This bad larry allows you to make sick readme files that will impress your mom, grandmom, girlfriend or boyfriend, boss, jesus, the president, a baby, a dog, your cat and everyone inbetween. This sweet baby bahjesus takes the guess work out of conventionally writing a readme by boiling down all of the boring stuff into a few short questions that goes so fast, you'll freak! Kinda like jimmy johns. Not in sandwich form but just as delicious!
